Jekyll is a static site generator that is written in ruby. Jekyll takes text files and renders them into HTML page. If you are looking for a simple web page or blog without having a database or maintaining a lot of code then Jekyll is for you. Another bonus for Jekyll is that you can host your page on GitHub pages.
