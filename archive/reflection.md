What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
- I learned how how all of these are invisible properties that you need to take into account when adjusting height and width. Padding helped add a little neatness effect so it didn't seem like all the content was together. The border's I actually used these to keep track of how much space is inbetween each boxes; more for debugging. Margin was a tough one as I would only get results a few times and I usually used this to center object.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
- That it is the hardest part of css! I still am iffy on the positioning it was a lot of trial and error. The biggest thing I learned about positioning when it comes to controlling the flow of the boxes is to create one big container and break each section up into boxes.It was still challenging and I need to go research some more so I can learn it as it is probably the most crucial part of css; in my opinion.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
- The easiest to implement were the navigation and the links pretty much straight forward as long ass you apply the atrributes correctly. The hardest no doubt for me was the positioning I had to redo my blog to get get something decent before the deadline and it looks like something from the stone age but at least the boxes are contained and the footer stays at the bottom. Sorry whomever is looking at this its late and I am just venting as much as I can on positioning.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
- I learned how css can get pretty complex as you can quickly end up with 40+ classes. This is why I learned how naming your selectors is important and commenting to be able to keep track of what classes effect specific parts of the page.
