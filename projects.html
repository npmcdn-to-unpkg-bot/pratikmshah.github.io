    <p class="prj-desc">Prism is a web app that refactors color into sound. It takes a png image and analyzes the colors, luminence, and contrast of the image. It then generates a custom sound set consisting of a melody, pad, and percussion. This was a team project that was created in 7 days at Dev Bootcamp</p>

    <img src="/img/projects/iDunno.png">
    <p class="prj-desc">iDunno is a single page cheatsheet resource application that is a collection of links and snippets. The interface and design is similar to Goolge with just plain search and topic selector. The problem to solve is to have a one stop shop to look up resource instead of having multiple widows open. This app is still a work in progress depending on actual usability and may change. It uses AngularJS(1.5) as the framework and is desktop first app</p>
