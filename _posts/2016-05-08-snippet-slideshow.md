Creating an automated slideshow plugin may look a little challenging at first but its actually pretty simple once you break it down. This plugin will allow you to show a set of images that transition every X seconds. It will be reusable and for a great example check out my projects page to see them in action.

### Requirements?

There are a couple of things we will need in order for this to work. First, you will need the jQuery plugin which you can find [here][JQUERY]. Another item we will need is of course a set of images! Images need to be the same height and width. I used JPEG images for performance but give up quality; for more information on file types check out this [post][IMG_FILE].
